Build ID: 3182346c-d10e-418d-aa89-6f3d35a9b6fb, 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000, 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Deliverable Version: 21G1.01.00
Generator Version: 21G1.01.00
Build Date: 2021-03-21

Description:
    This is an evaluation release comprised of obfuscated RTL with a limited address range. 
    It can be used to synthesize the design, as well as execute software using the included RTL testbench and FPGA bitstream.
    Note that the included SpyGlass LINT/CDC/DFT checks, as well as some of the included software tests, may fail due to restrictions of the evaluation deliverable.

Core IP Generator Change Log:
For 21G1.01.00
    New Core IP features and deliverables changes over 20G1 release
    * Added the DebugDriver, a collection of Verilog tasks, that perform low-level debugging functions.
    * Added debug_from_tile_X outputs to notify external logic when each core is in debug mode.
    * Added support for driving AMBA PROT/CACHE signals for E/S-series cores with supervisor-mode capability.
    * Added the Branch History Mode option for Nexus trace. This option results in better trace compression but uses more logic.
    * Added memory-latency test for L1/TIM/L2/DLS/Memory/System/Peripheral ports.
    * Added support for instrumented print's in simulation logs.
    * Added asynchronous and full-asynchronous reset options to 3- and 5-series cores.
    * Added PKA which provides basic modular operations to efficiently implement public key based algorithms (e.g. ECDSA).
    * Added the option for a Public-Key-Based authentication protocol for enabling debug.
    * Added the Pin Interface Block (PIB) option to send Nexus trace data off-chip to a trace probe.
    * Added the option for the core complex configuration to include more than one trace sink type, selected by software at run-time.
    * Made base address of debug module configurable. The design will use slightly more silicon area when the debug module is not based at zero.
    * Made SBus width configurable. Increasing the width of this bus can help increase bandwidth and lower latency for cores with L2 Caches.
    * Made the number of AXI ID bits configurable for AXI System, Memory and Front Ports.
    * Integrated SystemC Debug Notification with Freedom Studio.
    * Changed debug authentication password from pre-specified value to external inputs.
    * Changed BEU local interrupt to use resumable NMI.
    * Replaced extraction options with a port-punching option for SRAMs and clock gates.
